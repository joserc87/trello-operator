TRELLO OPERATOR
---------------

A simple [chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-operator/hdhgahihkcogpabmijdknjijdiepbclp)
to collapse cards based on their tags

I suspect that it could be executed in Tamper Monkey, but I haven't tried it
yet. Feel free to debug and send pull requests.
